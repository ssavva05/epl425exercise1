Instructions:
0) Compile the project
1) Run server
 java MultiThreadedTCPServer 9999 1000  
                              |    |->Number of repetitions
                              |------>Port Number
2) Run client
 java TCPClient 192.168.1.10 9999
                         |    |->Port Number
                         |------>Server IP
3) Extra parameters on Server file (MultiThreadedTCPServer.java) 
    -> Can change the thread pool size by change the value on THREAD_POOL_SIZE 
    This will change the ammount of request that will be executed simulataneusly.   
4) Extra parameters on Client 
    -> Can change the thread pool size by change the value on SIZE_OF_POOL
    This will change the ammount of request that will be executed simulataneusly. 
	  -> The number of clients NUMBER_OF_CLIENTS
    This will change the ammount of users that will sent request to server.
    This satisfy the requirement that said we need N users.
	  -> The number of clients NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS_PER_CLIENTS
    This will change the ammount of request that can sent one user to the server.
    This satisfy the requirement that said at least 300 requests by each user.
